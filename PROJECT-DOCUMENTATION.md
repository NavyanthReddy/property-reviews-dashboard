# Flex Living Reviews Dashboard - Project Documentation

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: Headless UI, Heroicons, Lucide React
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization
- **HTTP Client**: Axios for API requests
- **Date Handling**: date-fns
- **Deployment**: Netlify-ready configuration

## Key Design & Logic Decisions

### Schema Normalization
- **Unified Review Interface**: Created a consistent `Review` type that normalizes data from different sources (Hostaway API, Google Places, mock data)
- **Flexible Channel Support**: Supports multiple booking channels (Airbnb, Booking.com, VRBO, Direct, Google)
- **Category-based Ratings**: Handles both overall ratings and category-specific ratings (cleanliness, communication, etc.)

### Filter & Search Architecture
- **Multi-dimensional Filtering**: Rating ranges, channels, categories, approval status, date ranges
- **Search Implementation**: Full-text search across guest names, comments, and listing names
- **Real-time Updates**: Filters apply instantly without page refresh
- **URL State Management**: Filter state persists in URL parameters for bookmarking/sharing

### Data Management Strategy
- **Mock Data Fallback**: Graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries with user-friendly messages
- **Caching Strategy**: Client-side caching with proper invalidation
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage for API responses and component props

## API Behaviors

### `/api/reviews/hostaway` Example Output

```json

        "listingId": "12345",
        "listingName": "2B N1 A - 29 Shoreditch Heights",
        "guestName": "Shane Finkelstein",
        "rating": 10,
        "comment": "Shane and family are wonderful! Would definitely host again :)",

        "isApproved": true,
        "isDisplayed": true,
        "tags": ["cleanliness", "communication", "respect_house_rules"]
      }
    ],

      },
      "channelBreakdown": {
        "airbnb": 12,

    "isApproved": true
  }
}
```

### API Features
- **Filtering**: Supports rating, channel, category, approval status, date range filters
- **Search**: Full-text search across multiple fields
- **Statistics**: Real-time calculation of review metrics and distributions
- **Pagination**: Handles large datasets efficiently
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error response format with helpful messages

## Google Reviews Integration

### Status: âœ… Fully Implemented & Documented

**Technical Implementation**:
- Complete Google Places API integration
- Working API client with error handling
- Dedicated testing interface at `/google-reviews`
- Proper TypeScript definitions and response normalization

**Key Findings**:
- **Feasible**: Technical integration successful
- **Limitations**: 5 reviews per place, cached data, no response capability
- **Cost**: $17 per 1000 requests (~$0.034 per property)
- **Setup**: Requires Google Cloud billing account

**Recommendation**: Use as supplementary to Hostaway API due to limitations and costs. Full analysis documented in `GOOGLE-REVIEWS-EXPLORATION-REPORT.md`.

### Integration Features
- Place search by name/address
- Review retrieval and normalization
- Configuration status checking
- Cost transparency and limitations disclosure
- Graceful fallback when not configured

## AI Tool Disclosure

I used ChatGPT (OpenAI) to assist with brainstorming, step-by-step guidance, and clarifying design choices.
